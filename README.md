# Unibridge Project
The unibridge project was born with the aim of unifying the thousands of processes of the various scripts useful for compatibility without affecting the ego of the developers who create the script, no name, just a common idea for all of us with the aim of improving the platform, below are the benefits of developing the resource and its future use.

## Advantages
- LESS CODE used to intercept the framework and adapt the scripts to the framework
- DEV FRIENDLY for resource development and speeding up the creation process
- SERVER FRIENDLY for error interception and debugging totally managed by ox_lib
- ONE RESOURCE that works to make everything work instead of 1000 libs or 1000 integrated bridges that do the same thing

## Rules
- Forks are not recommended except for pull requests as the idea is to unify and not give away the base of a bridge to make further versions of it
- If you are the Owner of a Framework you can submit a contribution request by contacting me on Discord to add your profile to make direct changes to the script
- If you are a Creator interested in using the system you can contact me on Discord and provide the bridge functions for the scripts to work by agreeing to their modification and improvement by third parties in accordance with the use of them by all participants in the project and the availability to change the script functions for its operation with this script
- If you are the Owner of a server you can share the project to the creators and propose to contribute to the project
